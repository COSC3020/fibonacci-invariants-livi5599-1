# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

Invariant: For each recursive call to fibHelper with a given n, all elements in the array a at indicies less than n will be defined with the correct Fibonacci value if they are still needed for the computation of arr[n].

For the code, I recieved help from ChatGPT and Megan.  ChatGPT gave me the idea of defining an array with n undefined elements and the idea of using a helper function, and Megan gave me the idea of defining the first element of the array in the fib function since when I was testing it, the base case of 0 would never be reached.

ChatGPT helped me come up with the invariant.  The invariant I first came up with was, "The array a will have at least one undefined element until after the last recursive call," which ChatGPT used to help me revise it into the invariant I gave above.
